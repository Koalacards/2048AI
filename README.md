# 2048AI
Hayden, Ben H and Ben B's final project for CS4100 AI Fall 2021.

How to run the AI's:
Go into the file with the Agent that you are looking for. Towards the bottom, there should be some code with either a play_n_times or a play_agent function being called. Update the wanted configuration there, then run the command `python3 [file name]`
